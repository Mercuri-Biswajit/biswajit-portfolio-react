      problem:
        "The client wanted a compact 3BHK home on a near-square 33'6\" x 33'2\" plot while maximising liveable area and natural light in all three bedrooms. The central constraint was that the client's family requires a large shared dining space (20'+ wide) for regular family gatherings, but the plot size made this feel incompatible with fitting three properly-sized bedrooms and functional kitchen and bathroom spaces.",
      solution:
        'The column grid was carefully aligned so that the dining hall spans between perimeter columns with no internal obstruction, achieving a 20\'-5" clear dining width. Bedrooms were sized at 11\'-10" x 11\'-10" — above the typical minimum — by eliminating corridor waste through direct-access room arrangement around the central staircase. A 9" x 12" column section was used (rather than the typical 9" x 9") to handle the longer beam spans over the dining area without increasing beam depth visibly.',
      challenges: [
        "Fitting 3 bedrooms, a large dining hall, kitchen, 2 bathrooms, front verandah, and a staircase within 1,115 sq.ft required multiple layout iterations to satisfy both structural column requirements and the client's spatial brief.",
        'The 16\'-1" front verandah projection required careful cantilever detailing to avoid visible downward deflection at the tip while keeping the slab thickness to 5".',
        "Coordinating the dog-legged central staircase so that it aligned with the structural grid — avoiding cutting any primary beam — took iterative design refinement.",
        'Zone III seismic detailing required closer stirrup spacing at beam-column joints, which was technically challenging given the 9" x 12" column dimensions and congested reinforcement.',
